Selenium Class 7

Handling multiple windows (tabs):
In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

the original page where you navigate will be called parent handle
and additional tab opened afterwards will be called child handle

Most of the time when you interact with links they will open a new tab or a window
