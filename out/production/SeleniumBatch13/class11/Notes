Actions Class :
 Is given by Selenium to capture keyboard and mouse events such as :

 move to element
 drag and drop
 double click
 right click

Perform is to perform a certain action from the actions class

If regular click doesnt work we can use alternative way of having Actions class click method

 Inorder to upload documents suing Selenium we simply do
 sendKeys(filePath)

 If sendKeys does not work, we can use Robot interface.

JavaScriptExecutor :
 It is a library in Selenium which can be executed in different programming languages
 (java, c# , python etc.)

 scroll through the page
 highlight the element
 scroll to a specific element
 open a new tab
